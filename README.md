# Analog-clock
I have created my first simple project "Analog-Clock" using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.I learned more about transform,z-index,positioning property in CSS and function call in JS,
this makes me even more exciting that i am publishing in GIT for the first time.Please have a look and kindly share your feedback if it can be done in any other ways.
