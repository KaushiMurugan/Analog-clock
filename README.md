# Analog-clock
I created my first simple project "Analog-Clock" using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. I learned more about transform,z-index, positioning property in CSS and function calls in JS,
this makes me even more excited that I am publishing in GIT for the first time. Please have a look and kindly share your feedback if it can be done in any other way.
